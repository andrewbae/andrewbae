Greetings, I'm Andrew Bae who is living in South Korea.  

I'm interested in English and hacking such as pwn and reverse engineering. Additionally, real-world bug hunting is my favorite too.

What doesn't kill me makes me stronger is my motto. I'm trying to making motivation myself every moment.

I'm focusing on learning the heap structure for exploitation these days.

I'm solving up a lot of hacking challenges for making up the good scores at the CTF competitions.

Every moment when I succeed to exploit something, that sense of achievement makes me falling into hacking especially.

Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/andrewbae/andrewbae/issues)
