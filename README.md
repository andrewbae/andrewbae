Greetings, I'm Andrew Bae who is living in South Korea.  

I'm interested in English and hacking such as pwn and reverse engineering. Additionally, bug hunting is favorite too.

No pain, no gain is my motto. Make motivation for my self every moment and learning painfully. That is my way.

I focused on learning the heap structure for exploitation in these days.

For making up good score at CTF competitions, I'm trying to solve up many hacking challenges.

Every moment when I success to exploit something, that sense of achievement make me falling in hacking especially.

Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/andrewbae/andrewbae/issues)
